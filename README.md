In this project, a system was designed to facilitate music learning through the integration
of Augmented Reality, Computer Vision, and Artificial Intelligence technologies. The
aim was to address the needs of students lacking access to a private teacher or guide,
particularly in the early stages of their education. Limitations such as lack of time,
economic resources and geographical distances restricted them to taking traditional
learning options in media that are static and lack interactivity such as books, videos or
audio. The system provides an enriching learning experience by allowing students to
engage in immersive lessons, interact in real-time with musical elements, and grasp
abstract concepts inherent in music through practical application. Moreover, the
development is scalable and improvable, with the capacity to evolve and offer advanced
features in the future. This significantly broadens musical learning opportunities, meeting
current needs and adapting to continuous growth and enhancement. The project was
conceived with the intention of empowering individuals, providing them the opportunity
to explore and cultivate their passion for music in a more accessible, personalized, and
exciting manner.
